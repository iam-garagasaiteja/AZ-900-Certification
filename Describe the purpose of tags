🌟 Describe the Purpose of Tags in Azure

As your cloud footprint grows, proper organization becomes essential for managing resources, costs, security, and governance.
Azure Tags are key-value pairs that you apply to resources to attach meaningful metadata.

🎯 What Are Tags Used For?

Tags help classify, organize, and manage Azure resources across multiple workloads and environments. They provide flexibility beyond subscriptions and resource groups.

🧩 1. Resource Management

Tags let you identify resources linked to:

Specific workloads

Environments such as Dev, QA, Prod

Business units

Application owners

👉 This helps search, filter, and perform actions on related resources easily.

💰 2. Cost Management & Optimization

Tags allow you to:

Group resources by cost center

Build reports by department/team

Track budgets and forecast costs

Chargeback or showback costs

👉 Helps organizations understand who is spending what.

🛠️ 3. Operations Management

Tags help categorize resources by operational importance:

Mission-critical

High-impact

Low-impact

👉 Useful for setting SLAs, performing capacity planning, or mapping availability priorities.

🔐 4. Security Classification

Tags identify the security level of data or workloads:

Public

Internal

Confidential

👉 Enables better access control and security posture management.

📜 5. Governance & Compliance

Tags help ensure adherence to standards:

They support compliance frameworks like ISO 27001.

Azure Policy can enforce mandatory tags (e.g., Owner, Department).

Policies can automatically reapply missing tags.

👉 Ensures consistent governance at scale.

🤖 6. Workload Optimization & Automation

Tags can link resources to:

Workloads or applications

Deployment pipelines

Automation tasks (using Azure DevOps / Scripts)

👉 Enables bulk automation—for example, shutting down all resources with Environment = Dev.

🏷️ Example Tag Structure
Tag Name	Purpose
AppName	Application that the resource supports
CostCenter	Internal billing code
Owner	Business owner or responsible person
Environment	Dev / Test / Prod
Impact	Mission-critical / High-impact / Low-impact

📌 Not all tags need to apply to all resources—only use what provides value.

🔧 How to Manage Tags

You can manage tags using:

Azure Portal

Azure CLI

PowerShell

ARM Templates

REST API

Tags do not inherit automatically from subscriptions or resource groups, giving you the flexibility to design your own tagging hierarchy.
