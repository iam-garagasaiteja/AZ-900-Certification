☁️ What is the Shared Responsibility Model?

The Shared Responsibility Model defines who is responsible for what in cloud computing —
that is, which responsibilities are handled by the cloud provider (like Microsoft Azure) and which by you, the customer.

In a traditional datacenter, your company does everything — from building security to software updates.
But in the cloud, these responsibilities are shared.

🧱 Provider vs. Consumer Responsibilities
Cloud Provider (e.g., Microsoft Azure)	Customer (You / Organization)
Physical datacenter (buildings, guards, etc.)	Data stored in the cloud
Power, cooling, and hardware maintenance	Who can access your cloud resources
Physical network and connectivity	Device security (laptops, phones)
Physical hosts (servers)	Identity management (user accounts, MFA)
⚙️ How It Changes with Cloud Service Type

Now, the “shared” part depends on what type of cloud service you use:

1️⃣ IaaS – Infrastructure as a Service

You manage more.
Provider gives you virtual hardware (VMs, storage, networking), but you handle everything above that — operating systems, apps, patches, and data.

🧩 Example:
You create a Virtual Machine (VM) in Azure.

Azure (Provider) handles: physical servers, datacenter, and hypervisor.

You (Customer) handle: installing Windows/Linux OS, updating it, installing software like SQL, and securing your data.

👉 Think of it like renting a house — the owner provides the structure, but you furnish and maintain the inside.

2️⃣ PaaS – Platform as a Service

You manage less.
Provider manages infrastructure and runtime environment — you only manage your application and data.

🧩 Example:
You use Azure SQL Database or Azure App Service.

Azure maintains the OS, database engine, and patches.

You only manage your database tables, schema, and data.

👉 Think of it like renting a fully furnished apartment — you just bring your belongings and live; the landlord maintains the furniture and electricity.

3️⃣ SaaS – Software as a Service

Provider manages almost everything.
You simply use the software through a web browser or app.

🧩 Example:
Using Microsoft 365 (Outlook, Teams, OneDrive) or Salesforce.

Microsoft manages everything — servers, OS, app, and updates.

You only manage your user accounts and data (like emails, files, etc.).

👉 Think of it like staying in a hotel — the hotel takes care of cleaning, electricity, and maintenance; you just use the room.

🧩 Summary Table
Layer	On-Premises	IaaS	PaaS	SaaS
Applications	You	You	You	Provider
Data	You	You	You	You
Runtime	You	You	Provider	Provider
Operating System	You	You	Provider	Provider
Virtualization	You	Provider	Provider	Provider
Servers	You	Provider	Provider	Provider
Storage	You	Provider	Provider	Provider
Networking	You	Provider	Provider	Provider

✅ As you move from On-Premises → IaaS → PaaS → SaaS,
your responsibility decreases and the provider’s responsibility increases.

💡 Real-World Example Summary
Scenario	Type	Your Responsibility	Provider’s Responsibility
You host your own server in your office	On-premises	Everything (hardware, OS, patches, data)	None
You rent a VM on Azure and install your app	IaaS	OS updates, app, and data	Hardware, virtualization
You use Azure App Service to host your web app	PaaS	App code and data	OS, runtime, hardware
You use Microsoft 365 for email and docs	SaaS	Data (emails, files), user access	Everything else
🧠 In Simple Words:

The Shared Responsibility Model ensures security and management tasks are clearly divided between you and the cloud provider —
helping both sides know exactly what they must protect and maintain.
