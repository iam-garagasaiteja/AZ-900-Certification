Here’s a **simple, structured explanation** of using **BASH in the Azure CLI** along with a **table** and **flow diagram** to make it easy to remember 👇

## 🖥️ **1. Switching Between CLI Modes**

| Mode                 | How to Enter                     | Prompt Example      | Common Use                                       |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **PowerShell CLI**   | Default (or type `pwsh` in Bash) | `PS /home/user>`    | For PowerShell-specific commands like `Get-Date` |
| **BASH CLI**         | Type `bash` in PowerShell        | `username@azure:~$` | For Linux-style commands like `date`             |
| **Interactive Mode** | Type `az interactive`            | `az>>`              | For guided, auto-complete Azure commands         |

## ⚙️ **2. Example Commands**

| Task                      | PowerShell Command | BASH Command     |
| ------------------------- | ------------------ | ---------------- |
| Get current date/time     | `Get-Date`         | `date`           |
| Update Azure CLI          | `az upgrade`       | `az upgrade`     |
| Switch back to PowerShell | —                  | `pwsh`           |
| Enter Interactive Mode    | `az interactive`   | `az interactive` |
| Exit Interactive Mode     | `exit`             | `exit`           |

## 💡 **3. Azure CLI Interactive Mode**

Interactive mode acts like a **mini IDE** inside your terminal.

### ✨ Features:

* **Auto-completion** for commands
* **Command descriptions** and **examples**
* **No need to type `az`** before commands

**Steps to use:**

1. Type `az interactive`
2. Choose whether to send telemetry (YES/NO)
3. Wait for initialization
4. Type a letter (like `a`) to test auto-complete
5. Try commands such as `upgrade` or `version`
6. Type `exit` to quit

## 🔄 **4. CLI Flow Summary**

```
Start Azure Cloud Shell
│
├── PowerShell Mode (default)
│     ├── Run PowerShell commands (e.g., Get-Date)
│     └── To switch → type "bash"
│
├── BASH Mode
│     ├── Run Linux commands (e.g., date)
│     ├── Azure commands start with "az"
│     └── To switch back → type "pwsh"
│
└── Interactive Mode
      ├── Enter with "az interactive"
      ├── Get auto-suggestions
      └── Exit with "exit"
```

## ✅ **5. Key Takeaways**

* **PowerShell = Windows style**, uses commands like `Get-Date`
* **BASH = Linux style**, uses commands like `date`
* **Interactive Mode = Beginner-friendly**, offers hints and auto-completion
* You can **switch freely** between modes (`bash`, `pwsh`, `az interactive`)
