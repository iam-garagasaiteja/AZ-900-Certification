🧠 Goal

Estimate the cost of running a basic web application on Microsoft Azure using the Pricing Calculator.

🌐 Scenario: A Basic Web App
Component	Function
ASP.NET Web App (Windows)	Displays product inventory and pricing
2 Virtual Machines (VMs)	Host the web app and share traffic
Load Balancer	Distributes network traffic evenly
SQL Database	Stores inventory and pricing information

🖼️ Azure Migration Setup

On-Premises → Azure Cloud
---------------------------------
Web App (VMs) → Azure Virtual Machines
Load Balancer → Azure Application Gateway
SQL Database → Azure SQL Database

⚙️ Requirements

📊 Step 4: Review the Estimate

At the bottom of the calculator:

Total Estimated Monthly Cost is displayed.

You can change currency (e.g., USD, INR).

💼 Step 5: Save, Share, or Export
Option	Description
Export	Download as Excel
Save / Save As	Store estimate for later under “Saved Estimates”
Share	Generate a shareable link for your team
✅ Outcome

You’ve created a cost estimate for running your web application on Azure.
You can now:

Adjust configurations to see cost impact.

Compare different regions or VM sizes.

Plan budgets before deployment.
