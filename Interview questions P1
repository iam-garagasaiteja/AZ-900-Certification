## ☁️ **1️⃣ Cloud Concepts (25–30%)**

### 🔹 Q1. What is Cloud Computing?

**Answer:**
Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services like servers, storage, databases, networking, and software over the internet (“the cloud”).
You pay only for what you use and can scale resources anytime.

**Example:** Using Azure Virtual Machines instead of buying physical servers.

---

### 🔹 Q2. What are the main cloud deployment models?

**Answer:**

1. **Public Cloud** – Shared infrastructure (Azure, AWS, GCP).
2. **Private Cloud** – Dedicated infrastructure for one organization.
3. **Hybrid Cloud** – Combination of both, allows data and apps to move between them.

---

### 🔹 Q3. What are the advantages of cloud computing?

* Cost-effective (Pay-as-you-go)
* Scalability and elasticity
* High availability and reliability
* Global reach
* Security and compliance

---

### 🔹 Q4. What are the main cloud service models?

**Answer:**

1. **IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)** – You manage OS and apps.
   *Example:* Azure Virtual Machines.
2. **PaaS (Platform as a Service)** – You manage only your app and data.
   *Example:* Azure App Service, Azure SQL Database.
3. **SaaS (Software as a Service)** – Everything is managed by provider.
   *Example:* Microsoft 365, Salesforce.

---

### 🔹 Q5. Explain the Shared Responsibility Model.

**Answer:**
Responsibilities are shared between cloud provider and customer.

* **Provider:** Physical datacenter, network, servers.
* **Customer:** Data, identity, access, device security.
* Responsibility level changes depending on IaaS, PaaS, or SaaS.

---

## 🏗️ **2️⃣ Azure Architecture and Services (35–40%)**

### 🔹 Q6. What are Azure Regions and Availability Zones?

* **Region:** A geographical area (like East US, Central India) where Azure has datacenters.
* **Availability Zones:** Separate datacenters within a region to ensure high availability and fault tolerance.

---

### 🔹 Q7. What is the difference between Azure Resource Group and Subscription?

* **Subscription:** Logical container for billing and access control.
* **Resource Group:** Logical container for grouping related resources (VMs, databases, etc.) in a project.

---

### 🔹 Q8. What is an Azure Virtual Machine (VM)?

A Virtual Machine is a software-based emulation of a physical computer that runs in the cloud.
You can choose OS, size, and manage it like your own server.

---

### 🔹 Q9. What is Azure Storage and its types?

**Azure Storage Types:**

1. **Blob Storage** – For unstructured data (images, videos, backups).
2. **File Storage** – For shared files using SMB protocol.
3. **Queue Storage** – For message-based communication between components.
4. **Table Storage** – For NoSQL structured data.

---

### 🔹 Q10. Explain Azure Virtual Network (VNet).

A **VNet** is like your own private network in Azure.
It allows resources (VMs, services) to securely communicate with each other, on-premises networks, or the internet.

---

### 🔹 Q11. What are Azure App Services?

App Service is a **PaaS** offering that allows you to host web apps, REST APIs, or mobile backends without managing infrastructure.

---

### 🔹 Q12. What is Azure SQL Database vs SQL on VM?

* **Azure SQL Database:** Managed PaaS database — Microsoft handles patching and maintenance.
* **SQL on VM:** IaaS — You install and manage SQL yourself.

---

### 🔹 Q13. What is Azure Active Directory (Azure AD)?

Azure AD is Microsoft’s **identity and access management service**.
It controls authentication and authorization for users, devices, and applications.

---

### 🔹 Q14. What is Azure Resource Manager (ARM)?

ARM is the deployment and management service for Azure.
It allows you to create, update, and delete resources using templates (JSON), PowerShell, or CLI.

---

## 🧩 **3️⃣ Azure Management and Governance (30–35%)**

### 🔹 Q15. What are Azure Management Tools?

1. **Azure Portal** – Web UI.
2. **Azure PowerShell** – Command-line scripting.
3. **Azure CLI** – Cross-platform command-line tool.
4. **ARM Templates** – Infrastructure as code.

---

### 🔹 Q16. What is Azure Policy?

Azure Policy helps enforce rules and compliance on resources.
For example: Prevent creation of resources in non-approved regions.

---

### 🔹 Q17. What is Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)?

RBAC allows you to assign **roles** (like Reader, Contributor, Owner) to users, groups, or apps to manage permissions on Azure resources.

---

### 🔹 Q18. What is Azure Cost Management?

It helps you track, analyze, and control your cloud spending.
You can set **budgets**, **alerts**, and view **cost breakdowns** by resource.

---

### 🔹 Q19. What is an Azure Subscription?

It’s a logical container that holds your resources and defines **billing** and **access control** boundaries.

---

### 🔹 Q20. What is Azure Security Center (Defender for Cloud)?

It provides **threat protection**, **vulnerability assessment**, and **security recommendations** across your Azure resources.

---

## ⚙️ **Bonus — Practical / Scenario-Based Questions**

### 🔹 Q21. Your application needs to scale automatically based on demand. Which Azure feature will you use?

**Answer:** Use **Azure Autoscale** (part of App Service or VM Scale Sets).

---

### 🔹 Q22. You want to store 10 TB of image data accessed via the internet. Which storage type fits best?

**Answer:** **Azure Blob Storage (Hot Tier)** — optimized for frequently accessed unstructured data.

---

### 🔹 Q23. How do you secure data in Azure?

* Use **Encryption at rest (Storage Service Encryption)**
* Use **Encryption in transit (HTTPS/TLS)**
* Manage keys in **Azure Key Vault**
* Enable **RBAC and MFA** for access control

---

### 🔹 Q24. You want to host a web application without managing servers. Which service should you choose?

**Answer:** **Azure App Service (PaaS)**

### 🔹 Q25. What is the difference between Azure AD and Active Directory?

* **Active Directory (AD)** – On-premises identity service for Windows domains.
* **Azure AD** – Cloud-based identity service for managing users and applications online (SaaS, Microsoft 365, etc.).

---

## 🧠 **Pro Tip for Interviews**

For each question:
