🧠 What is Cost Management?

Microsoft Cost Management is an Azure service that helps you monitor, analyze, and optimize your cloud spending.
It ensures you have visibility and control over how resources are used and billed — preventing unexpected costs.

⚙️ Key Functions
Feature	Description
Track Costs	View Azure resource usage and spending trends across subscriptions, regions, or services.
Analyze Spending	Use visual dashboards and cost analysis to understand where costs are accruing.
Create Budgets	Set spending limits for subscriptions, resource groups, or services.
Set Alerts	Receive automatic notifications when costs or usage reach specified thresholds.
Automate Cost Control	Link budgets to automation workflows (e.g., scale down or shut off resources).
📊 Cost Analysis

Cost Analysis is a subset of Cost Management. It allows you to:

Visualize total costs across different dimensions (region, resource, time period).

View aggregated organizational costs.

Identify spending trends and estimate future costs (monthly, quarterly, yearly).

Compare actual costs against budgets.

🖼️ In the Azure Portal:
The Cost Analysis dashboard provides visual charts and filters for quick exploration of your expenses.

🚨 Types of Cost Alerts

Cost Management provides three main types of alerts to keep spending in check:

Alert Type	Purpose	Trigger
Budget Alert	Notifies when spending or usage exceeds defined budget limits.	Budget threshold (e.g., 80%, 100%)
Credit Alert	Notifies when Azure credit balance is nearly or fully consumed.	90% and 100% of Azure credits used
Department Spending Quota Alert	Notifies when department-level quota thresholds are reached (for Enterprise Agreements).	e.g., 50% or 75% of quota

💡 All alerts appear in the Azure portal and can send email notifications automatically.

💵 Budgets

A budget defines a spending limit for Azure usage.
You can create budgets based on:

Subscription

Resource group

Service type

Department or cost center

🧩 Budget Features

Budget Alerts: Trigger when costs or usage exceed thresholds.

Notifications: Send automatic emails to stakeholders.

Automation Integration: Optionally connect to automation workflows (via Azure Logic Apps or Azure Automation) to:

Stop unused resources

Adjust configurations dynamically when budget is exceeded.
